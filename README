=Setf= is such a wonderful macro.  Sometimes we forget.  It is one of the first
things I find missing when I have to resort to an imperative language, which is
exactly the place where you want to use it the most.  But there seems to be a
shortcoming in Common Lisp when it comes to functional programming.  What I mean
is, it is incredibly easy to mutate state with =setf=, but when we want to use
data in a functional way, it becomes much more cumbersome to do what is needed.
For example...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; Let's try something in a non-fuctional way
(let ((list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
  ...
  ;; Change the 5th element in the list to t
  (setf (fifth list) t)
  ... )

;; Let's try it functionally
(let ((list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
  ...
  ;; Change the 5th element in the list to t
  (labels
      ((replace-nth (nth list new-val)
         (if (> nth 0)
             (cons (car list) (replace-nth (- nth 1) (cdr list) new-val))
             (cons new-val (cdr list)) )))
    (setf list (replace-nth 4 list t)) )
  ... )
#+END_SRC

The cleanest way I could think to do this (barring what will follow) is to
define a function that would do this for me.  There is nothing wrong with that,
and many will state that this general function should be placed in a toolbox so
it can be used in the future saving me such effort from now on.

I find, however, that such functions are defined and often never used again,
not because I don't need them but because I forget the work I've done in the
past.  (Not to mention that the function above isn't nearly general enough.
What happens if you want to replace the =cdr= of the n^{th} element, or the
=cadar=?).

If you've read Graham's /On Lisp/, there are probably a couple of functions
(=ttrav=, =trec=) floating around in your head that might serve our purposes
here.  I believe that Graham would state that making functions like the one
above easier to write alleviates the problem.  I find that using such "one off"
methods still uses a bit too much mental overhead when coding.

Now, look at what =setf= does for us.  It hides functions like =rplaca= and
=rplacd= which no sane individual should spend grey matter on.  =Setf= knows how
to invert =(car x)= and =(cdr x)= into the proper mutating "function".  Wouldn't
it be nice if we had a functionality like =setf= that keeps track of and inserts
the proper functional manipulation code.  To this end I have created =modf=.

=Modf= is a macro that behaves like =setf=, except it returns a new object with
the requested properties rather than makes the changes in place.  It changes
functional example from above into...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; Let's try it functionally
(let ((list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)))
  ...
  ;; Change the 5th element in the list to t
  (modf (nth 4 list) t)
  ... )
#+END_SRC

Right, that's all well and good, but that isn't nearly the most use you can get
out of this.  Let's say we were using the FSet =seq= data structure to hold a
Sudoku board.  We might use a =seq= of =seq= structures to represent our board.
If we want to set a number on the board, we would do this...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(let ((board (make-board)))
  ;; Set element (4,3) to a 2
  (modf (fset:@ (fset:@ board 4) 3) 2) )
#+END_SRC

...instead of like this...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(let ((board (make-board)))
  ;; Set element (4,3) to a 2
  (fset:with board 4 (fset:with (fset:@ board 4) 3 2)) )
#+END_SRC

...which is considerably more convoluted.  But to really nail this home,
consider that we have a mess such as this...

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

(defclass test-class ()
  ((slot1 :initform 1)
   (slot2 :initform 2)
   (array :initform #() :initarg :array) ))

(defmethod print-object ((obj test-class) str)
  (with-slots (slot1 slot2 array) obj
    (format str "#<TEST-CLASS: SLOT1: ~S, SLOT2: ~S, ARRAY: ~S>"
            slot1 slot2 array )))

      (cons 
       (make-instance 'test-class
                      :array (vector
                              (aref (slot-value (second crazy-datastructure)
                                                'array) 0)
                              (aref (slot-value (second crazy-datastructure)
                                                'array) 1)
                              (concatenate 'string
                                           (subseq 
                                            (aref (slot-value
                                                   (second crazy-datastructure)
                                                   'array) 2)
                                            0 1)
                                           "EL"
                                           (subseq 
                                            (aref (slot-value
                                                   (second crazy-datastructure)
                                                   'array) 2)
                                            3))))
       (cddr crazy-datastructure) ))

#+END_EXAMPLE

Here we made it simple to functionally modify parts of a data structure that
includes a string nested in an array nested in a class nested in a list.  =Modf=
acts as a shorthand for complicated functional manipulations.  If you examine
the macro expansion of the =modf= form, you will see something very similar to
the hand written code to change the deeply nested substring.

** How it works

Really, when it comes down to it, =modf= is a simpler functionality than =setf=
because any modifier can be represented as a function.  This isn't true with
=setf=.  Consider...

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(let ((x 5))
  (setf x 5) )
#+END_SRC

...there is no function you can call with arguments =x= and =5= which has the
effect of setting the lexical variable =x= to =5= in this scope.  This isn't
true of functional changes as we are returning the modified value.  That is not
to say that this didn't turn out to be a tricky macro to write.  This is due to
the fact that the construction mechanism has to be in the reverse order of the
access forms encountered during the expansion.

You can define macro like "rewrites" with =define-modf-rewrite= that translate
access code into other access code that =modf= knows how to deal with
(e.g. =(cadr x) -> (car (cdr x))=).

You define expansion functions similar =(defun (setf func) ...)= and =(defmethod
(setf func) ...)= with =define-modf-function= and =define-modf-method=,
respectively.

You define expansions based on the lexical structure of the code via
=define-modf-expander= (this is analogous in some sense to
=define-setf-expander=).  This allows you to invert forms like =(car x)= to the
builder code =(cons new-value (cdr x))=.  These functions return new code that
will replace the old code that was passed as an argument to the function.

In principle there is no need to have =define-modf-expander=, since any modifier
can be expressed as a function.  It might be beneficial to "open code" certain
=modf= expansions as it will give the compiler a crack at optimizing the
resultant code.

** The Code

I am putting up a [[https://github.com/smithzvk/modf][clone of my repository]] on Github.  I am not sure that the code
is ready for public consumption, yet.  I will try, in the somewhat near future,
to strip out some of the dependencies and make sure it builds on Lisp images
other than mine.  I would like to see the removal of the dependency on my
toolbox library and implementing facilities for FUNDS.
